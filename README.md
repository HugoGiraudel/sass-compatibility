Sass Compatibility
==================

Sass compatibility issues between different engines.

## Building

You'll need a couple things to get started.

### Docker

See [Docker installation instructions][docker-install] for all supported
platforms.

[docker-install]: https://docs.docker.com/installation/#installation

On OS X and Windows, you can download and install boot2docker
([OS X][b2d-osx], [Windows][b2d-win]).

[b2d-osx]: https://github.com/boot2docker/osx-installer/releases/latest
[b2d-win]: https://github.com/boot2docker/windows-installer/releases/latest

```sh
boot2docker init
boot2docker up
```

### Ruby

If you don't already have Ruby setup you can get it with your favorite
package manager (like Brew on OS X), or download the installer from the
[Ruby website][ruby-install].

[ruby-install]: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#installers

### Bundler

Once you have Ruby installed you need to install the `bundler` gem, and
use it to install the required gem dependencies.

```sh
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

## Running

Execute the test suit via bundler.

```sh
bundle exec rake
```

The Rakefile will:

* Clone [sass-spec](https://github.com/sass/sass-spec) and symlink
  `sass-spec/spec` to `spec` if needed.
* Load tests from `_data/tests.yml`.
* Download Docker images of the Ruby Sass and LibSass executables.
* Compile each test input with all supported engines, and normalize the
  output CSS (creating `output.#{engine}.css` files in the test
  directory).
* Create a `expected_output_clean.css` from `expected_output.css` for
  each test using the same normalization rules.
* Compare the output of each engine with the expected output and create
  a `support.yml` file in each test directory (containing the results
  for this test).
* Aggregate the test data for every feature described in
  `_data/tests.yml`, in `_data/support.yml`.
* Compute support stats in `_data/stats.yml`.
* Create a (summarized) SCSS version of the stats in
  `_sass/utils/_stats.scss`.

## I/O YAML structure

### `_data/tests.yml`

This file contains a list of features to test, with one or multiple
tests (relative to the project root) for each feature.

```yaml
call_function: spec/basic/60_call

angle_conversion:
  - spec/libsass-clised-issues/issue_666/angle
  - spec/libsass-clised-issues/issue_666/length
```

A test, according to sass-spec, is a directory with `input.scss` and
`expected_output.css` files.

### `_data/support.yml`

All the features described in `_data/tests.yml` are present, but will
now contain the test results, for each engine, with details for each
individual test.

If `support` is `true` for an engine, all the tests passed. If `false`,
all the tests failed. If `nil`, the results were mixed.

```yaml
call_function:
  ruby_sass_3_2:
    support: false
    tests:
      spec/basic/60_call: false
  ruby_sass_3_4:
    support: true
    tests:
      spec/basic/60_call: true

angle_conversion:
  ruby_sass_3_2:
    support:
    tests:
      spec/libsass-closed-issues/issue_666/angle: false
      spec/libsass-closed-issues/issue_666/length: true
  ruby_sass_3_4:
    support: true
    tests:
      spec/libsass-closed-issues/issue_666/angle: true
      spec/libsass-closed-issues/issue_666/length: true
```

**Note:** I stripped some engines from the example output to keep it
lightweight.
